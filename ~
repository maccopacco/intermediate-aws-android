Weird dates from PlaidToAmp multithread issue

* Slap a synchro on PlaidToAmp, hasn't failed a few times. Calling it

* Maybe try creating a new date format object each call to avoid the
  synchro and keep things multithreading and fast? If its the date
  formatter thats not handling the multithreading as opposed to the
  method, that will fix it. Time both
